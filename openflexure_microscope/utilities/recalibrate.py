    the gains/shutter speed and resets the lens shading correction to a unity
    gain.  Rather than take a single raw image and calibrate from that (as 
    done in the open loop version, which is a more or less direct Python port

    table to make it uniform.  It seems that doing this 3-5 times gives much
